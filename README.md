# Password-Box

A small exercise to practice some javascript features:

String methods, for loop, ternary operator, event listeners, random number generator, and functions.

How it works:
User submits a request for a random password to be generated based on a few parameters (whether to include numbers, and/or symbols, and the length of password). 
<br>
A password is generated based on the preferences selected and is returned to the user.
